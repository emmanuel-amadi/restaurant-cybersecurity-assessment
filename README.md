Restaurant Cybersecurity Assessment – Portfolio Project

Project Overview

This project is a full cybersecurity assessment of a mid-sized restaurant environment, performed using industry frameworks and best practices including NIST CSF, PCI DSS, and hospitality security guidelines.

The goal of this assessment was to evaluate network security, POS practices, employee awareness, and incident readiness — then deliver a professional recommendation roadmap aligned with real-world GRC and SOC analyst responsibilities.

Key Objectives
	•	Assess internal and guest Wi-Fi security
	•	Evaluate POS account hygiene and physical security
	•	Review employee cybersecurity awareness
	•	Analyze backup, outage, and incident response readiness
	•	Identify medium–high risk findings and remediation steps

⸻

Findings Summary

High-Risk Issues
	•	Open guest Wi-Fi with no authentication
	•	Written POS passwords near terminals
	•	Staff leaving POS systems unlocked
	•	Infrequent internal Wi-Fi password rotation

Medium-Risk Issues
	•	IoT systems on uncertain segmentation
	•	Limited camera coverage in sensitive areas
	•	No standardized credential breach response

⸻

Recommendations

This assessment includes a structured 30/60/90-day roadmap covering:
	•	Secure Wi-Fi architecture
	•	Removal of visible password exposure
	•	POS lockout policies
	•	Enhanced surveillance coverage
	•	IoT segmentation
	•	Formal identity compromise handling
	•	Alignment with PCI DSS requirements

Full recommendations are included in the PDF report.
